I am currently a Ph.D. student in the security lab (SecLab) at UCSB, and a recipient of the 2018 IBM Ph.D. [fellowship](https://www.research.ibm.com/university/awards/2018_phd_fellowship_awards.shtml). Formerly, I was a member of the technical research staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. I obtained a B.S. in mathematics, a B.S. in computer science, and a minor in economics from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.S. in computer security from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research interests include: usable authentication, embedded systems security, novel introspection techniques, and smart card security.
